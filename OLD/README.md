# Reddit Wherever

Reddit Wherever adds Reddit comments to Youtube Videos and also allows you to view Reddit comments of any webpage. 

By default YouTube comments will be replaced with the relevant Reddit comments. YouTube comments can still be viewed by clicking the YouTube icon located at the top right of the comments section.

If the extension icon turns red while browsing it means that the current webpage has been submitted to Reddit. Clicking the icon will open a popup where you can view the posts and comments associated with the URL. 

Options:
- Dark mode
- Run browser popup only when icon is clicked
- Show YouTube comments as default

Reddit Wherever contains no ads, and signup is not required.
